## What is nyxt.ai?
It's a Chrome extension that allows you to summarize any article.


## Why use nyxt?
Performance and ease of use are at the core of Nyxt.

It's powered NVIDIAÂ® TensorRT LLM, enabling nearly instantaneous summaries.

Nyxt features beautiful, soothing animations as summaries are generated.
